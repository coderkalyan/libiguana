# libiguana

A collection of simple, standalone zig utilities that I use across my projects.

## List
* StringPool: An interning string pool implementation.

## Usage
Utilities are standalone wherever possible, and have no dependencies outside the standard library. Either add the library to your dependencies:
`$ zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/coderkalyan/libiguana.git`
or simply copy the source files you need into your project.
```
